SHOOTING TYCOON

Press space to shoot gun
Press arrow keys to move your person

The object of the game is to get the highest score before you die. Points are gained by shooting the red "V"'s that represent enemies. If the players ships collides with obstacles (white 0's) or an enemy, one life will be lost. The game will end when all 3 player lives are lost, or the user exits the window.

Good luck!!!
